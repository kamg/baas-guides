# Catalyze BaaS Guide

At [Catalyze](https://www.catalyze.io/), we are working hard to make building HIPAA-compliant Health Care applications easier for developers. This guide will walk you through many, but not all, aspects of the [Catalyze Backend as a Service](https://www.catalyze.io/backend-as-a-service/) (BaaS).

### About the Catalyze BaaS

The Catalyze BaaS is a set of REST APIs that provide all the tools needed for developers to build safe and secure HIPAA-compliant mobile and web applications. It provides user management (sign up, login, password management), flexible data storage and query capabilities, SMS messaging and cloud file storage, all in a safe and secure cloud hosted environment.

We handle the servers and infrastructure so you can focus on building the next great mobile health care application. All customers on our paid plan are covered under a Business Associates Agreement, making HIPAA compliance possible for developers who once thought it too expensive or risky.

A free developer tier is also available for you to try out the platform. Sign up for an account at https://dashboard.catalyze.io.

### Intended Audience and Skillset

This guide is intended for developers that have web or mobile applications development experience. Experience using REST APIs and other backend API services is also recommended. Base knowledge of HTTP return codes and data formatted as JSON is also important.

We also assume that you can handle running command line tools on your chosen OS. The examples in this guide use **curl** to make HTTP calls against the API. You are not required to use **curl** to interact with the BaaS API. We have found the [Postman](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCYQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fpostman-rest-client%2Ffdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm%3Fhl%3Den&ei=RQGIU5_BItS1sAS-sIHQDw&usg=AFQjCNHaecLwAKk91gpdCY_y1x_ViIrHwQ&bvm=bv.67720277,d.cWc) Chrome plugin to be particularly useful. [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/) is also very useful for catching JSON errors common when building API requests.
