## Mobile BaaS

This guide is intended to familiarize you with making API calls against the [Catalyze Mobile backend as a Service](https://catalyze.io/backend-as-a-service/) (BaaS)
and configure an environment that will allow you to quickly follow other Catalyze guides.

Many of the steps in this guide can be completed via the Dashboard in addition to the API. Feel free to follow either approach when setting up the guide environment.

**Guide Requirements**

To get through this and other Catalyze guides you will need the following:

- Developer Account
    * If you haven't already, sign up for a Catalyze [Developer account](https://dashboard.catalyze.io). Make sure to activate your account and successfully log in to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.catalyze.io) before continuing.
- A terminal that can run **curl** (bundled with OS X, most Linux, Windows via cygwin)

### Log In

To access the API's administrative functions, many of which are mirrored in the Dashboard, a session token is required. If you intend to use the Dashboard for completing this guide you can skip this section.

#### From the API:

After verifying that your account is active by successfully logging in to the Dashboard, run the following command to obtain a session token to use on additional calls to the API. You will need to replace the values for **&lt;username&gt;** and **&lt;password&gt;** with your credentials.

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser developer.catalyze.io 32a384f5-5d11-4214-812e-b35ced9af4d7"  https://api.catalyze.io/v2/auth/signin -X POST -d '{"username": "<username>","password": "<password>"}'
```

Record the **sessionToken** value in the response JSON for use in future calls.

#### From the Dashboard:

If you haven't logged in to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.catalyze.io) yet, go ahead and do it now.

### Create an Organization

Organizations are a collection of applications that are treated as a unit for the purposes of managing administrators and developers. Typically one organization is sufficient for building a small number of applications, but when more and more developers start collaborating on applications it makes sense to create multiple organizations to partition up the applications.

For this step you will be creating an Organization under which to create applications used for testing the API. If you already have created an organization you are free to use it for the rest of this guide. For the purposes of this and future guides we will use the name "ExampleOrg" and suggest you name your organization accordingly.

Note that the user that creates an organization is automatically the administrator of the organization and has complete control over all aspects of the organization as well as the applications within the organization.

#### From the API:

Only two fields are required when creating an organization: **name** (the name of the organization) and **description** (a brief description of the organization).

Run the following command to create the organization after replacing the value for **&lt;sessionToken&gt;**:

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser developer.catalyze.io 32a384f5-5d11-4214-812e-b35ced9af4d7" -H "Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/org -X POST -d '{"name": "ExampleOrg", "description": "An example for testing ACLs."}'
```

Record the **orgId** value in the JSON response for use in future calls.

#### From the Dashboard:

Organizations can be created from the [Organization section](https://dashboard.catalyze.io/account/organization/) of the Dashboard. The **orgId** is shown in the Overview section, as **ID**, when you click on an organization.

### Create an Application

The next step is to create an application within ExampleOrg. We suggest using a new application for working through this and other guides, but you can use an existing one if you like. We will refer to this application as "ExampleApp" for all future guides and references to the application. We suggest you name your application accordingly.

#### From the API:

Run the following from the command line, substituting the **&lt;sessionToken&gt;** and **&lt;orgId&gt;** with values from the previous steps:

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser developer.catalyze.io 32a384f5-5d11-4214-812e-b35ced9af4d7" -H "Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/app -X POST -d '{"orgId":"<orgId>","name": "ExampleApp", "description": "An example for running through Catalyze guides."}'
```

Record the **appId** value for future calls.

#### From the Dashboard:

Go to the [Applications section](https://dashboard.catalyze.io/applications/) of the Dashboard and click **Add new app** from the left navigation bar. Fill in the name ("ExampleApp") and description information. Select ExampleOrg from the list to create the application within that organization.

Once the application is created, note the value of **Application ID** when clicking on the application in the Dashboard. That value will be used as the **appId** in future API calls.

### Create an API Key

All operations against an application require an API key. In most cases only one API key is needed. This section walks through creating an API key.

API keys are inserted into the **X-Api-Key** HTTP header. You can see examples of using the Dashboard's API key in the curl examples above. Yes, the Dashboard is actually an application running on the Catalyze Mobile BaaS!

All API keys have three parts, separated by a space: the **type** (browser, ios, android), **identifier** (a string of your choice) and a **UUID**. All three parts together form a API key and each API key is associated with a single application. API keys can be added and deleted but never updated.

#### From the API:

Run the following from the command line, substituting the **&lt;sessionToken&gt;** and **&lt;appId&gt;** with values from the previous steps:

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser developer.catalyze.io 32a384f5-5d11-4214-812e-b35ced9af4d7" -H "Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/apiKey/<appId> -X POST -d '{"type":"browser","identifier": "example.app"}'
```

Record the **id** for use in future calls. The full API key is

```curl
    browser example.app <id>
```

where **&lt;id&gt;** is the value of **id** from the response JSON.

#### From the Dashboard:

Go to the [Applications section](https://dashboard.catalyze.io/applications/) of the Dashboard and click on ExampleApp and then the **API Keys section**. Then click the **add api key** button to generate a key.

### Create Users

In this section we will create two users within ExampleApp for use in future guides:

- **Alice**: a medical doctor
- **Bob**: Alice's patient

We will be configuring the users such that Alice belongs to the **Supervisor** role, granting her the ability to create, read, update and delete any information within the application. As a regular user, Bob only has access to his data, and data that has been explicitly shared with him.

Managing users and roles to protect Protected Health Information (PHI) is an important aspect of building any Health IT application. We will cover additional capabilities for managing and protecting PHI in future chapters.

#### Create Alice

To create the Alice account, fill in the **&lt;emailAddress&gt;** field in the command below and run it. An activation email will be sent to the email address specified. You will not be able to use the account until it has been activated.

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser example.app afa81034-0d7c-4874-924a-e13fee59055c" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/users -X POST -d '{"username":"alice","password":"alice123", "email":{"primary":<emailAddress>}, "name":{"firstName":"Alice"}}'
```

Record Alice's **usersId** value for future use.

The activation email should appear in the email account provided within a few minutes. Once it arrives, click the activation link in the email and the account will be activated.

#### Create Bob

The command to sign up Bob is the same as signing up Alice but you will have to provide a different email than the one used to sign up Alice above.

**Hint:** if you use gmail or Google Apps add a **+** after your regular email handle followed by a unique string (e.g. *you+bob@gmail.com*) to generate a unique address that will get sent to your regular account.

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser example.app afa81034-0d7c-4874-924a-e13fee59055c" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/users -X POST -d '{"username":"bob","password":"bob123", "email":{"primary":"<emailAddress>"}, "name":{"firstName":"Bob"}}'
```

Record Bob's **usersId** value for future use.

Be sure to activate Bob's account before continuing.

#### Sign in as Alice and Bob

Log in as Bob by running the command below.

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser example.app afa81034-0d7c-4874-924a-e13fee59055c" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/auth/signin -X POST -d '{"username":"bob","password":"bob123"}'
```

Grab the **sessionToken** for future use. Session tokens have a limited lifetime, currently 24 hours, so keep this command handy in case the session times out.

Log in as Alice by running the command below.

    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser example.app afa81034-0d7c-4874-924a-e13fee59055c" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/auth/signin -X POST -d '{"username":"alice","password":"alice123"}'

Save the **sessionToken** for future use.

#### Make Alice a Supervisor

Update the application with Alice's **usersId** in the supervisors array. This is currently cumbersome via the API. You need to include the application's name, description and current list of users. This information can be retrieved by GETing the application. Replace the value for **&lt;appId&gt;** below and run the command.

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser developer.catalyze.io 32a384f5-5d11-4214-812e-b35ced9af4d7" -H "Authorization: Bearer 35206c61-b186-4a5a-9979-bce2e2fcaae8" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/app/<appId> -X GET
```

The update can then be constructed to add Alice's **usersId** to the **supervisor** array as such:

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key:  browser developer.catalyze.io 32a384f5-5d11-4214-812e-b35ced9af4d7" -H "Authorization: Bearer 35206c61-b186-4a5a-9979-bce2e2fcaae8" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/app/<appId> -X PUT -d '{"name":"ExampleApp","description":"An example for testing ACLs.","permissions":{"supervisor":[<usersId>],"user":[<listOfUsers>]}}'
```

The result JSON should now show Alice's **usersId** in the **supervisor** array. Making this operation easier is on our roadmap.

### Get an Administrator-level Session Token and API Key

For several operations within future guides, administrator-level access will be needed. In some cases these operations can be handled through the Dashboard, but not always.

To perform administrator-level operations from the command line, you will need to follow the steps below to obtain a session token and transient (temporary) API key. The API key will be generated on-the-fly by the API and is only valid for use with the included session token, and only during its lifetime (currently 24 hours).

First, get the **appId** for ExampleApp by clicking on the application within the [Application section](https://dashboard.catalyze.io/applications) of the Dashboard.

Next, use the **/auth/all** route using your developer portal **sessionToken** (from the **Log In** section above) to get a valid session and transient API key for ExampleApp.

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: browser developer.catalyze.io 32a384f5-5d11-4214-812e-b35ced9af4d7" -H "Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/auth/all -X GET
```

Find the entry matching ExampleApp's **appId** and store the values for **session** and **apiKey**. These values will be used in other parts of the guide to perform administrator level operations. Record them for future use.

### Create a Custom Class

For many of the examples in this guide we need a custom class within an application to test against.
We will now create a class called "ExampleClass". The class has two fields: **name**, a string, and **type**, an integer.

#### From the API:

Using the values for **session** and **apiKey** from the previous section, replace the values below and run the following command.

```curl
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: <apiKey>" -H "Authorization: Bearer <session>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.catalyze.io/v2/classes -X POST -d '{"name":"ExampleClass", "schema":{"name":"string", "type":"integer"},phi=true}'
```

#### From the Dashboard:

Select ExampleApp in the Dashboard and then click the **Custom Classes** section. Click the **add custom class** button and then enter ExampleClass as the name of the class. Under the **Add Entry** section, create entries for **name** of type **string** and **type** of type **integer**. Click the PHI checkbox and then **Add** to finish creating the class.

### Summary

The purpose of this section was to get you familiar with the API and the Dashboard and get your developer account environment configured such that you are ready to complete the rest of the guides in this section.

Please log in to the Dashboard and check that you see the following items to verify that this section was completed successfully:

- Organization: ExampleOrg
- Application: ExampleApp
- ExampleApp API key
- Custom class: ExampleClass

Also verify that you have recorded the values for the following (although they can be regenerated at any time by following the above steps again):

- A **sessionToken** for the Dashboard
- Values for **sessionToken** and **usersId** for both Alice and Bob
- Admin-level session token and corresponding API-key for ExampleApp

Also make sure that Alice and Bob's **usersId**s are in the **user** array when you GET the application (see Create an Application above). Alice's **usersId** should also appear in the **supervisor** array.
